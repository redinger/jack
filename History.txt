== 1.2.0 / 2008-02-14

* Update to use Rake 0.8's new #execute API.  Really sorry to all the Rake 0.7 lovers.
* Rake is now optional.  Require 'jack/rake'.  It's now called automatically by 
  Jack::Tasks#setup_queue and Jack::Tasks#jack_task too.  Otherwise, feel free to
  just include Jack::Tasks in your non-rake classes.

== 1.1.0 / 2007-10-13

* Add IMAP queue (unfinished)
* allow you to specify basic jack and queue tasks with jack_task and queue_task
* allow you to specify rake prereqs in #process_queue with :before

== 1.0.0 / 2007-08-25

* 1 major enhancement
  * Birthday!
